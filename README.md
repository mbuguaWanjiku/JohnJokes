### frontend

+  cd web-ui 

+ npm install to fetch the node modules

+ npm run start , runs in default port localhost:3000

+ npm run test for tests


###  backend

+  cd backend

+ npm install to fetch the node modules

+ npm run start , runs in default port localhost:3050

## Implementation

### Backend - Is divided into three layers namely 
+ Apis - controllers or routes

+ core -implementation of the business logic

+ services - used by core to fetch data

+ validators - used by controllers (apis) to validate request body


### Frontend - Is divided into three layers

+ services - fetch data from the api

+ containers 

+ components

## I was unable to fully test the modules due to time constraint.
